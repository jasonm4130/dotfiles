/**
 * JSON Config Guard
 *
 * PostToolUse hook on Edit/Write/MultiEdit/Bash. When an edited file is one of
 * Claude Code's JSON config files, re-parse it and report a syntax error back
 * to the model immediately.
 *
 * Bash is covered because a `sed -i`, a heredoc redirect, a `tee`, a `cp` or an
 * `mv` rewrites a config file without the write tools ever being involved — and
 * a guard that only watches Edit/Write is simply off for those sessions.
 *
 * Why this exists: Claude Code does not error on a malformed settings.json —
 * it drops the block it cannot parse and carries on. A stray comma in the
 * hooks object silently disables every guard in this repo, and the failure
 * surfaces a session later as "the hook stopped firing", with no error to
 * trace it back to. The edit that caused it is the cheapest place to catch it.
 *
 * PostToolUse runs after the write, so this cannot deny — it exits 2 with the
 * parse error on stderr, which Claude Code feeds back to the model as
 * something to fix now.
 *
 * This is an ADVISORY hook and fails OPEN: an unreadable stdin, an unparseable
 * payload, or a missing file exits 0. The guard exists to surface a mistake the
 * model just made, not to wedge the session when the harness surprises it. The
 * one thing it must never do is stay silent about genuinely broken JSON.
